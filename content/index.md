title: Welcome to Notes
---
### Welcome
This site contains the notes I have taken in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and published using [quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/). The entire project is hosted in [github pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages). The whole site is meant to be for personal use and accessing my notes easily in a neatly formatted way. If you want notes on any topic tho, you can create an issue on [the repo](https://github.com/devsiddhant/notes-quartz). No promises tho!
